## Project title: *Finance Tracker*

### Student name: *Vivek Prakash Shah*

### Student email: *vps5@student.le.ac.uk*

### Project description: 
*This project aims to develop an Android-based <b>Finance Tracker App</b> that enables users to efficiently manage their personal finances. The app will feature user authentication, allowing sign-in via email/password and Google. Users can set budgets, track expenses, and log income to monitor their financial health. The app will provide data visualization through interactive charts, helping users analyze spending and income trends. Additionally, it will support multi-currency, integrating a currency conversion API for accurate financial tracking. Users can also export their data in CSV format for external use.
The application will leverage Kotlin, Room Database for offline storage, Firebase for authentication and cloud backup. By implementing key financial management features in a mobile-friendly way, this project aims to improve user awareness and control over personal finances. The appâ€™s usability and effectiveness will be evaluated through user testing and feedback.*
